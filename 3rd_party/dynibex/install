Download and Installation

DynIbex is made of two main ingredients: an extension of the affine arithmetic and the validated Runge-Kutta methods. 
DynIbex comes in two flavor due to some improvements in Ibex library:
Old version (Ibex prior of version 2.1.14)

We assume that Ibex version 2.1.13 is installed correctly as explained in the Ibex documentation.
Download the DynIbex source code (for Ibex 2.1.13)
New version (Ibex version >= 2.1.14)

Since Ibex version 2.1.14, our implementation of affine arithmetic is now fully integrated into Ibex.
We assume that latest version of Ibex is installed correctly as explained in the Ibex documentation.
Download the DynIbex source code (tested with version Ibex 2.1.16)
We assume that the following sequence of commands are executed in Ibex directory.
Put the archive into the Ibex directory, then write the following commands:

	  Ibex foo$ tar xvfz tmp_install.tar.gz -C ibex-2.1.x
	  Ibex foo$ cd ibex-2.1.x
	  Ibex/ibex-2.1.x foo$ python ./install_plugin.py
	  Ibex/ibex-2.1.x foo$ ./waf configure [options]
	  Ibex/ibex-2.1.x foo$ ./waf install
	
You can access to a small API of DynIbex.
